            Gemma Mengual i Civil (Barcelona, 12th April, 1977) is considered one of the best synchronised swimmmers of all time. Among all her achievements are 24 world medals, 18 european medals and 2 Olympics medals. She retired in 2012, at the age of 35. In 2005 she was awared with the <i>Premio Reina Letizia</i> as "the best athlete of the year" by the Spanish Government, and in 2017 she was awared with the <i>Cruz de Sant Jordi</i> by the Catalan Government for her successful professional career.
        </p>
        <p>
            She started synchronized swimming at the age of eight. After her parents enrolled her in the Kallípolis Swimming Club in Barcelona, her coach Anna Tarrés added her to her team in 1992. In 1994 she finished in the second place at the European Youth Championship. She has competed in 4 Olympic Games: Sydney 2000, Athens 2004, Beijing 2008 and Rio 2016. She is the only swimmer in the world to have won four gold medals at European Championships.
        </p>
        <p>
            She was well known for her explosiveness and power in her arms and legs, and she was very agile and flexible in the water, and very expressive in her choreography.
        </p>
        <p>
            In December 2008, the UFEC named her "Best Catalan Athlete of the Year" (along with Andrea Fuentes). In 2010 she participated in the program The guest with Albert Om. On February 16, 2012 she confirmed her retirement "I retire because I have already given everything I could give to this sport", previously announced, from the world of high competition , although she stated that she would remain linked to the sport as an advisor to the coaching staff of the Spanish synchronized swimming team after the dismissal of Anna Tarrés i Campa.</p>
        </p>
        <p>
            She lives in Sant Cugat de Vallès. From the beginning, she has declared herself a faithful follower of RCD Espanyol. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Among other activities, it is worth mentioning that she has a degree in gemology, has been featured in magazines such as Sport Life and Interviú, and that she designs the swimsuits of the synchronized swimming team.
        </p>
        <p>The Government of the Generalitat de Catalunya awarded her the <i>Creu de Sant Jordi</i> on 11th April 2017.
